2730. Find the Longest Semi-Repetitive Substring
Medium

You are given a digit string s that consists of digits from 0 to 9.

A string is called semi-repetitive if there is at most one adjacent pair of the same digit. For example, "0010", "002020", "0123", "2002", and "54944" are semi-repetitive while the following are not: "00101022" (adjacent same digit pairs are 00 and 22), and "1101234883" (adjacent same digit pairs are 11 and 88).

Return the length of the longest semi-repetitive 
substring
 of s.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "52233"

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest semi-repetitive substring is "5223". Picking the whole string "52233" has two adjacent same digit pairs 22 and 33, but at most one is allowed.

Example 2:

Input: s = "5494"

Output: 4

Explanation:

s is a semi-repetitive string.

Example 3:

Input: s = "1111111"

Output: 2

Explanation:

The longest semi-repetitive substring is "11". Picking the substring "111" has two adjacent same digit pairs, but at most one is allowed.

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 50
'0' <= s[i] <= '9'
